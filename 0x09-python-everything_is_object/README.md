This README provides a concise explanation of key concepts in Python programming:

Object: An object is a specific instance of a class that has its own unique set of attributes and behaviors.

Difference between a class and an object/instance: A class is a blueprint that defines the attributes and behaviors that objects of that class will have. An object, also known as an instance, is a concrete realization of that class with its own data and functionality.

Difference between immutable and mutable objects: Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created, while mutable objects can be modified. Immutable objects include numbers, strings, and tuples, while mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets.

Reference: A reference is a value that points to an object in memory. It allows access and manipulation of the object's data.

Assignment: Assignment is the process of binding a name (variable) to an object. It associates the object with a reference and allows manipulation through that name.

Alias: An alias is when two or more names refer to the same object. Modifying the object through one name affects all other names referencing the object.

Identical variables: To check if two variables are identical, you can compare their values using the == operator.

Linked variables: To determine if two variables are linked to the same object, you can use the is operator. It checks if the two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.

Displaying variable identifier: In Python's CPython implementation, you can display the variable identifier, which represents the memory address, using the id() function.

Mutable and immutable: Mutable objects can be modified after creation, while immutable objects cannot be changed.

Built-in mutable types: Python provides built-in mutable types, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets, which allow modification of their contents.

Built-in immutable types: Python offers built-in immutable types, including numbers, strings, and tuples, which cannot be altered after creation.

Passing variables to functions: Python uses a pass-by-object-reference model. When variables are passed to functions, a reference to the object is passed, allowing modifications to affect the original object.
