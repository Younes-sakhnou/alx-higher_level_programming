Python programming is awesome due to its clear syntax, extensive standard library, and broad range of applications.
A superclass/baseclass/parentclass is the class that another class inherits from.
A subclass is a class that inherits properties from a superclass, extending its functionality.
Use the dir() function to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
Instances can have new attributes dynamically assigned to them.
Inherit a class from another by specifying the parent class in the class definition.
Define a class with multiple base classes by listing them separated by commas.
The default class every class inherits from is called object.
Override a method or attribute inherited from the base class by redefining it in the child class.
Subclasses inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes.
Inheritance promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization in object-oriented programming.
Use isinstance(), issubclass(), type(), and super() for type checking, inheritance operations, and method invocations.
