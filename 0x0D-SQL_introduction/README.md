**Introduction to Databases and Relational Databases**

A **database** is a structured way to store and organize information. It's like a digital storage system that lets you manage a lot of data easily. Information is kept in tables, rows, and columns, making it organized and efficient to search through.

A **relational database** is a type of database that's extra smart. It not only stores data but also shows how different pieces of data are related to each other. Imagine you have a "People" table and a "Hobbies" table â€“ a relational database can link each person to their hobbies without repeating information.

**SQL and MySQL**

**SQL** stands for "Structured Query Language." It's a language used to communicate with databases. Think of it as a way to ask questions and give commands to the database. You use SQL to create, update, delete, and retrieve data in a database.

**MySQL** is a specific kind of database system. It's like a powerful tool that uses SQL to manage and store your data. MySQL helps you create databases, tables, and other important things to keep your information organized.

**Creating Databases and Tables**

To **create a database** in MySQL, you use SQL commands to tell MySQL to make a new place to store your data.

**DDL** stands for "Data Definition Language." It's like the language you use to build and shape the structure of your database. With DDL, you can create new tables, modify existing ones, or even remove them.

**DML** stands for "Data Manipulation Language." It's like the language you use to work with the data inside your tables. You can add new data, change existing data, or remove data using DML commands.

**Working with Tables and Data**

To **create or alter a table**, you use DDL commands. This means you can tell MySQL to make new tables with specific columns and data types.

**Selecting data** means asking the database for specific information. You use SQL to tell MySQL what you're looking for, and it gives you back the right data.

You can also **insert, update, or delete data** in your tables using DML commands. This is how you add new information, change existing information, or remove information from your database.

**Subqueries** are like questions within questions. You can ask the database for data based on the results of another question. It's a way to dive deep into your data and get really specific information.

**Using MySQL Functions**

MySQL has special **functions** you can use. Functions are like tools that help you work with your data. They can do things like math calculations, text manipulations, and more.
